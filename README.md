# task_shopping

A new Flutter project for managing shopping tasks.

## Architecture
The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern. This pattern separates the user interface (View) from the application logic and data (ViewModel), which in turn communicates with the model layer.

sqflite: A plugin for SQLite databases.
path: Provides common path operations.
flutter_bloc: A state management library.
auto_route: A routing library for Flutter.
get_it: A simple Service Locator for Dart and Flutter projects.
flutter_rounded_date_picker: A Flutter package for picking a date or a range of dates.
intl: A library for internationalization and localization.
fl_chart: A Flutter library for drawing beautiful charts.
mocktail: A testing library for Dart and Flutter.
